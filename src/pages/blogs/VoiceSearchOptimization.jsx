            description: "Making your website secure is the first step to improving its performance in voice search. HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) not only builds trust with users but is also prioritized by search engines.\n\nWhy HTTPS Matters for Voice Search\n\nResearch by Neil Patel shows that 65% of voice search results come from HTTPS-enabled websites. This security feature ensures that data shared between your site and its visitors is encrypted, protecting against cyber threats.\n\nHow to Switch to HTTPS\n\nIf your site is still on HTTP, follow these steps to make the switch:\n\n    Get an SSL Certificate: Purchase it from a trusted provider or your hosting service.\n    Install the SSL Certificate: Most hosting platforms offer simple installation guides.\n    Update Your Links: Change all internal and external links to HTTPS.\n    Fix Mixed Content Issues: Use tools like WhyNoPadlock to identify unsecured elements.\n\nBy switching to HTTPS, you not only secure your website but also improve its chances of ranking in voice search results.",
