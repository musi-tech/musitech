            "description": "Back in August 2018, Google rolled out its infamous Medic Update, shaking up the rankings of many health-related websites. Websites that lacked medical expertise saw drastic drops in traffic. This wasnâ€™t an arbitrary decisionâ€”Google wanted to ensure that life-impacting content, especially in fields like healthcare and finance, came from reliable and knowledgeable sources.\n\nI remember a friend who ran a wellness blog. His traffic plummeted overnight despite having well-researched content. The problem? He had no medical credentials, no authoritative backlinks, and no clear trust signals on his site. This was a wake-up call for content creators worldwide: E-A-T isnâ€™t just a ranking factorâ€”itâ€™s a necessity.",

            "description": "E-A-T isnâ€™t an algorithm but rather a guideline Google uses to assess content quality. Hereâ€™s how each component works:\n\n1. **Expertise â€“ Whoâ€™s Writing Your Content?**\nGoogle values content created by experts. If youâ€™re writing about digital marketing, your background, experience, and published work should reflect your expertise.\nðŸ”¹ Real-Life Example: A digital marketer who has successfully managed multiple campaigns and shares case studies on their blog is seen as an expert.\nðŸ”¹ How to Improve: Showcase credentials, industry experience, and professional achievements. If youâ€™re writing about a specialized topic, consult an expert.\n\n2. **Authoritativeness â€“ Are You Recognized in Your Industry?**\nAuthoritativeness comes from industry recognition and credibility. Itâ€™s about how others perceive your expertise.\nðŸ”¹ Real-Life Example: A fitness trainer featured on leading health platforms will have stronger authority than an unknown trainer with no external references.\nðŸ”¹ How to Improve: Earn backlinks from authoritative sites, get mentioned in reputable publications, and collaborate with industry leaders.\n\n3. **Trustworthiness â€“ Can Users Rely on Your Content?**\nTrust is the foundation of any relationshipâ€”including the one between your website and visitors. Google prioritizes accurate, transparent, and credible content.\nðŸ”¹ Real-Life Example: An e-commerce website that provides clear return policies, secure transactions, and verified customer reviews will be trusted more than one with vague policies.\nðŸ”¹ How to Improve: Ensure factual accuracy, cite sources, display author bios, and use HTTPS security.",

Google asks the same question when ranking websites, and this is where E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) comes into play.
