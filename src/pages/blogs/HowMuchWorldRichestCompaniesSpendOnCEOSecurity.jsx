            description:
                "High-profile executives are not just employees; they are the public faces of their companies. Their decisions influence markets, impact millions of stakeholders, and often shape the global economy. This level of influence attracts attention, both positive and negative. Some of the primary reasons for the high cost of CEO security include:\n\n1. Public Visibility: CEOs like Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk are global icons, making them potential targets for personal and professional attacks.\n2. High-Stakes Decisions: With billions of dollars at stake, the security of these leaders directly affects their companies.\n3. Geopolitical Risks: Global travel and operations expose executives to diverse and unpredictable risks.\n4. Reputation Management: Any harm to a CEO can result in reputational and financial damage to their organization. The incident involving Brian Thompson underscores the gravity of these risks. It serves as a stark reminder that robust security is not optional but essential.",
