            description: "Sunil highlighted two key challenges Moloco faces:\n\nProving Performance: Convincing new customers about ML’s effectiveness can be tough. Sunil likened it to comparing two cars with different engines. Customers need to test the platform with their data to see its performance.\n\nSustaining Performance: For existing clients, maintaining consistent results is crucial. ML models must adapt to changes in consumer behavior. For instance, habits shifted significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Updating models with real-time data is essential to stay relevant."
