            description: "BiteDance’s Hongo app shows how fast this trend is growing. In January 2024, the app had 10 million active users. By March, this number doubled to 20 million. By September, it hit an incredible 120 million active users. These numbers are not just impressive; they are revolutionary. The growth is faster than what we have seen in traditional entertainment formats like TV or movies. This rise is not surprising. People today have busy schedules. They have less time to sit and watch long shows. Their attention spans are shorter. Short form dramas fit perfectly into these habits. The episodes are quick and easy to watch. This makes them perfect for people who are always on the go."
