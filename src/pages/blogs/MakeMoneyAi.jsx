                "Affiliate marketing involves promoting other companies' products and earning a commission for every sale made through your referral. It's one of the easiest ways to make money with AI tools like ChatGPT, which can help you create content and promote affiliate links effectively. With platforms like Amazon Associates or ClickBank, anyone can start making passive income from home. Affiliate marketing means promoting someone else’s service or product in return for a share of the money if your promotion results in a sale. It’s a really common way of making money online. In fact, it’s one of the ways Andy got started making money online 10+ years ago with his site Awesome Stuff to Buy. Example of Ways to Make Money with AI (Affiliate Marketing) Awesome Stuff to Buy. All kinds of companies have affiliate programs that you can sign up for. Amazon Affiliates is the biggest out there (though you’ll typically only get 5% of each sale). Other affiliate programs offer higher percentages—often 50% or even more. Bluehost, for instance, offers 70%+ for each qualified sale. I’ve made more than $50,000/mo in affiliate income over the years. It’s a pretty great channel.",

                "Developing AI chatbots for businesses is a lucrative way to utilize AI technologies. You can build bots using AI tools like GPT-3 or GPT-4, offering solutions for customer service, sales, and lead generation. Freelancers and small businesses can sell chatbot services to clients who want to automate their customer interactions. If you’ve ever contacted customer services through an online chat, you’ve likely encountered an AI chatbot. These handy AI tools can tackle all kinds of tasks, like answering common questions, booking appointments, offering product recommendations, troubleshooting technical issues, tracking orders, and escalating issues to a human agent if there’s a bigger problem.\n\nAI chatbots are a huge time-saver for businesses, and they let even tiny companies provide customer support 24/7. More and more companies are coming on board with using AI-powered chatbots… but the task of developing, training, and implementing a chatbot can be a huge hurdle to a time-strapped business owner. That’s where you (and your side hustle!) could come in. You could either provide an off-the-shelf chatbot, tailored to a specific industry, or you could create and tweak chatbots that are individually designed for your clients.",

                "AI tools can help create or optimize e-commerce stores, automating tasks like product recommendations, customer support, and inventory management. Using platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce combined with AI, you can provide personalized shopping experiences and drive more sales.\n\nSince the early days of the internet, people have been creating e-commerce stores to sell products online. Amazon was one of the earliest, in the mid-1990s. Platforms like WooCommerce (for WordPress) and Shopify have made it easy to create e-commerce sites without any technical knowledge.\n\nWith AI, it’s easier and faster than ever to create your own online store. You can use AI to design and create the website itself, with many website builders now offering a “done for you” solution with AI. From brand colors to layouts, AI can tackle it all (and you can tweak things how you want).\n\nWhen it comes to what to sell on your site, you’ve got a few different options. If you’re running your store as a side hustle, you’re probably not going to want to create or commission your products yourself. Instead, you could:\n\n - Buy products from a wholesaler. You’ll then charge customers a higher price to cover your costs and to allow for a profit: this usually means charging 2–3x the wholesale price. You’ll need space to store products before they sell, and you’ll need to ship products out.\n - Use a dropshipping service to store and send products on your behalf. Sales are fulfilled for you by the dropshipper, but margins can be low and you’ll be competing with other e-commerce sites selling the exact same products.",

For instance, the popular WordPress website builder Elementor is now powered by AI, and you can also use the highly flexible page builder Divi to create full WordPress sites in minutes. With website building AI tools, you can create websites with AI-designed layouts, AI-generated images, and even AI-written text.

Another great side business is to create and sell an online course. If you design this as a self-study course (one that doesn’t need you to interact with students), then you can sell it over and over again—without needing to spend much time on it after the initial creation work upfront (like I do with my Built to Blog course). Platforms like Udemy, Teachable, and Thinkific have made it really easy to create and sell online courses. The tricky part is coming up with your material, and that’s where generative AI can be an incredible time-saver. With AI tools, you can come up with course ideas, develop your marketing materials, and even write a full course outline. You could even create the scripts for your videos—along with AI images to use for your slides or bonus downloadables.",

As a freelancer, you can use AI tools like Jasper or Writesonic to produce content at scale, boosting your income by taking on more clients. There’s no denying that the huge rise in the popularity (and viability) of generative AI has disrupted the freelance writing industry. But there’s still work out there for freelancers—especially those who can use AI effectively. With the help of AI writing tools, you can quickly draft huge volumes of text. Your content creation business might involve writing SEO-focused articles for a blog, ad copy, email newsletters, social media posts, or anything else that a client needs from you. We’ve got plenty of tools in RightBlogger to help you with all kinds of top quality content and copy. These include: The Article Writer Tool to create full-length blog posts that need minimal editing. This is best used along with our Keyword Research Tool (if your client hasn’t provided a keyword) to make sure your article is well-positioned to rank in search engines. The Press Release Tool to craft a correctly formatted press release about a new or updated product. If you’re not quite sure how to structure a press release or what to include, this is a great tool to try. The Freelance Proposal Generator and Freelance Contract Generator tools to quickly create proposals for potential clients—and contracts for the gigs you win.
