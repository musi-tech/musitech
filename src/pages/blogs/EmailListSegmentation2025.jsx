            description: "Email list segmentation is the process of dividing your email subscribers into smaller, targeted groups based on shared characteristics, behaviors, or interests. Instead of sending the same email to everyone, segmentation helps you deliver personalized content that resonates with specific audiences.\n\nFor example, if a group of subscribers is interested in fitness, you can send them tailored emails about workout routines or health tips. The Mailtrap tutorial emphasizes that sending generic emails to your entire list is ineffective—segmentation is the key to better engagement.",
