    The first step in competitor keyword analysis is identifying who your competitors are. These are websites that consistently rank higher than you for the keywords you want to target.
    
    - **Search on Google:** Start by typing in a keyword you want to rank for. Look at the top results in the search engine results page (SERP). These websites are your direct competitors for that keyword.
    - **Niche-Specific Competitors:** Focus on competitors within your niche or industry. These are the ones directly targeting your audience.
    - **Tools to Identify Competitors:** Tools like Keywords Everywhere, SEMrush, or Ahrefs can help you find competitors by analyzing SERPs and showing the top-ranking sites for your target keywords.
    
    Once you know your competitors, you can move on to analyzing their strategies.

    Keywords are the foundation of SEO. To outperform your competitors, you need to focus on the keywords driving traffic to their websites.
    
    ### Use a Keyword Research Tool
    Install a tool like Keywords Everywhere on your browser. This tool gives you insights directly from search results. When you search for a keyword, it shows:
    - **Backlink Metrics:** The number of backlinks and referring domains for competing pages.
    - **Traffic Metrics:** The monthly traffic for individual pages and the entire domain.
    - **Keyword Rankings:** A list of keywords a page or domain ranks for.
    
    ### Focus on High-Traffic Keywords
    When analyzing competitors’ keywords, look for high-traffic keywords that align with your website's content. These are the keywords you want to prioritize. Check the:
    - **Search Volume:** Keywords with higher search volume can bring more visitors.
    - **Traffic Contribution:** Identify which keywords contribute the most traffic to a competitor's page.
    
    For example, if your competitor ranks for “benefits of SEO” and this keyword brings in 120 visits per month, create content targeting that keyword.

    Keyword gap analysis helps you find keywords your competitors rank for but you do not. This process shows where your content is lacking and gives you new opportunities to target.
    
    ### Steps to Perform Keyword Gap Analysis
    1. **Open the Competitor Gap Analysis Tool:** Tools like Keywords Everywhere have a “Competitor Gap Analysis” feature. You can also use SEMrush or Ahrefs for this task.
    2. **Enter URLs:** Enter your website URL and up to five competitor URLs.
    3. **Analyze the Results:** The tool will show keywords your competitors rank for, but you don’t.
    
    ### What to Look For
    - **Relevant Keywords:** Focus on keywords related to your website.
    - **Traffic Potential:** Check the average monthly traffic for each keyword.
    - **Competition Level:** Look for keywords with low competition but decent search volume.
    
    For example, if your competitor ranks for “SEO benefits for small businesses” and you don’t, that’s an opportunity to create content targeting that keyword.
